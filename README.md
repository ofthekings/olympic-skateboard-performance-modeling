# Modeling Performance Bias in Olympic Park Skateboarding (Tokyo 2020 vs Paris 2024)

## Brief description of Project

This project analyzes how the geometry of Olympic park skateboarding courses (Tokyo 2020 vs Paris 2024) influences trick feasibility. Using a geometry-based dataset and statistical modeling, I quantify design-induced performance bias and compare how different course layouts advantage or disadvantage trick families.

## Setup

activate your conda environment.

From your virtual environment:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
