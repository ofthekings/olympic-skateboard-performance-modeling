ChatGPT was used for help in setting up the Fisher test and the Synthetic Data.


## Brief description of Assignment/Project

This project looks at whether the geometries of the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympic park skateboarding courses favour particular trick families, and whether a simple geometry-based model can quantify such design-induced performance bias. More specifically, my research question: “Can a geometry-based model of park-style skateboarding courses be used to estimate how the layouts of the Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024 Olympic park courses could advantage or penalize different trick families, and to quantify the resulting design-induced performance bias?”



## Setup

activate your conda environment.

From your virtual environment:
